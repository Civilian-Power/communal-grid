# Communal Grid
## _Connecting home & business owners' energy-making/saving devices & the virtual power plants with which they can connect_

1. **Consumers/businesses**: _earn money with devices you already have_
2. **VPPs**: _quickly onboard highly-qualified leads_
3. **Smart hubs**: _increase the value & stickiness of your 'home dashboard' app_
4. **Grid**: _dramatically expand capacity without new Transmission & Distribution lines_

**Problem statement:** Understanding whether any of your existing home or business' devices can connect with money-returning [Virtual Power Plant (VPP)](https://rmi.org/clean-energy-101-virtual-power-plants/) services, much less which _potential_ devices could work in your existing setup _and_ earn you money is a maddeningly complex, regionally different, byzantine process that is not conducive to _expediting humanity’s move to clean all-electric power & a grid that can support that sizable shift._

Communal Grid is a **programmatically-accessible catalo**g of the various interconnection and management opportunities as well as security characteristics of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) devices (whether for consumer or commercial usage) to outline which products may or may not work with your smart home network (Hubs) and/or VPP provider(s). By exposing this catalog in this manner, anyone can create/edit device, hub, and VPP 'recipes' to ensure the community has the latest information on these devices' capabilities and connections.

Imagine if your home-/business-level management layer (a Hub, like your Alexa, Google Home, or Home Assistant), which already knows all/most of the devices in your home, could: 
* identify which of your devices in your home/business are **eligible for enrollment in an VPP** to _earn you money_ (whether by adjusting your temperature or reducing power during peak system loads)
* know _which_ of your existing devices are enrolled in which VPP programs and **communicate real-time credits/payments**
* identity **what _new_ devices might best work with and support your existing** home/business infrastructure to add more VPP-capable connections.

### API
**Not yet available.** Once a reasonable corpus of devices, hubs, and VPPs are documented, an API will be made available for Hubs to query for:
* **OEM Product info** - _(input: product-name)_ return all details for a given OEM’s product, and which VPPs for a given market support this device
* **VPP support** - _(input: product-name, vpp-name)_ return an array of true/false for each market (for whether the VPP supports this device type) alongside the financial incentives offered
* **Hub compatibility** - _(input: product-name, hub-name)_ return true/false for whether the hub supports this device type


### Examples

The following are examples of the community-editable configuration files that would provide the data to the API for this project:
* [Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Slim with Energy Monitoring KP125M](https://github.com/Civilian-Power/communal-grid/blob/main/catalog/devices/outlets/tp-link-kasa-kp125m.json) _(See [all devices…](https://github.com/Civilian-Power/communal-grid/tree/main/catalog/devices))_
* [Renew Home OhmConnect](https://github.com/Civilian-Power/communal-grid/blob/main/catalog/vpp/renew-home-ohmconnect.json) _(See [all VPPs…](https://github.com/Civilian-Power/communal-grid/tree/main/catalog/vpp))_
* [Home Assistant Yellow](https://github.com/Civilian-Power/communal-grid/blob/main/catalog/devices/hubs/home-assistant-yellow.json) _(See [all Hubs…](https://github.com/Civilian-Power/communal-grid/tree/main/catalog/devices/hubs))_



### FAQs

#### Who has to participate for this to have value?
Value from this project can be seen in a number of ways (see FAQs below), but for any value to be accrued, at least two things need to happen:

1. **Contributions of data**: ideally, OEM manufacturers would begin providing the data as the technical owners who know the most details about their products. However, the Homebrew project has shown that individuals, customers, home/small businesses owners willingly provide far more onerous details and solutions On their own as they improve their home management layer (Hub) experience. Contributions could easily be made by anyone with a GitHub account and a browser.
2. **Exposure of data**: At present, the biggest point of leverage for the use of the data would be in the home management layer (hubs) as they would provide (with a single integration) home/business owners (who already have these Hub devices installed) visibility to the VPP enrollment, device compliance, and additional device compatibility opportunities. 



#### Who gets what out of this solution?

##### What does a homeowner/business owner get?

Home/business owners and renters can discover ways to earn money through their *existing* smart home investments (helpful to this projects’s ultimate goal) without needing to do lots of research, AND simplify understanding of what additional devices would work with the system they already have (beyond the purpose of this project’s initial goals), AND have a better understanding of their home network security(beyond the purpose of this project’s initial goals), AND simplify enrollment and configuration of their VPP setup using an interface they already use and trust (e.g. their smart home hub).


##### What does a smart home hub manufactuer get?

Smart home hubs develop an even "stickier" app surface for home/business owners as VPP enrollment and configuration can now occur *within* the smart home hub's application, AND they can earn referral dollars from the VPPs (who already pay referral kickbacks) by passing *better-qualified customers* (people from a known region, a known utility, and with known working devices that match the VPP's profile). 


##### What does an device manufacturer (OEM) get?

By contributing up-to-date information about their devices, OEMs can increase the sales of their devices (and the kickbacks VPPs many times offer them from successful enrollments) by increasing the chances of home/business owners discovering their products are available, compatible with their systems, and verified to work with a local VPP. Since many VPPs already pay OEMs a per-enrollment and per-yearly-usage fee, this increases OEM profits by having more OEM devices enrolled in more VPP programs.
​

##### What does a VPP get? 

By enabling Hubs to expose awareness of available VPPs to customers, AND attestation of which devices they currently own which can be leveraged by the VPP, AND then surface which additional OEM devices could further increase their earnings while working with the customer’s system. Further, the VPP can spend less time hunting qualified customers, and connect with them in an app/surface they already use (the smart home hub app/interfaces). 


##### What does a utility get?

Utilities get the upside of better meeting the dramatic increase in power generation needs in a world where utilities physically cannot build the infrastructure fast enough. VPPs offer one (of many needed) way to meet their region’s power needs without additional instructor buildout, and this solution drives more VPP enrollment to support the grid's explosive growth needs.



#### Is this a new communication channel VPPs, OEMs, or Hubs need to adopt?

No. The *communication standards and protocols* VPPs use to communicate with customers’ OEM devices can remain the same. The VPP never has to talk to the customer’s Hub, although there are plenty of customer experience improvements that would come from that shift (namely; customer’s data privacy, network security, and management experience fatigue). 

​In a future state where Hubs have better awareness of their connected OEM devices AND the VPP(s) being leveraged, there are **strong customer incentives** to have VPPs talk to the Hubs (rather than to each of the OEM devices) to give customers a single “pane of glass” to manage their home/business (rather than continue the proliferation of dozens of OEM management apps on top of the Hub and VPP. This would also improve user privacy, user security (one door, the hub, to secure, rather than each and every OEM device), user overhead (manage energy generation/demand reduction in one interface rather than dozens), and more. 



#### Shouldn't Hubs simply leverage the Matter Distributed Compliance Ledger (DCL) instead?

The [Matter Distributed Compliance Ledger](https://webui.dcl.csa-iot.org/) lets manufacturers post a device's certification status and detailed production information. However, the DCL is only for Matter devices (and most DERs presently are not Matter compliant). Further, it has no mechanism for listing and understanding a device's VPP support. For Matter devices registered in the Communal Grid, the DCL’s Vendor ID string can be supplied to connect the two sources. 


#### Doesn't Kraken's Mercury Consortium certification solve this?

[Mercury](https://kraken.tech/mercury) is certainly useful, but 
1. isn't ready for most devices in most markets today (as it relies on Utilities, VPPs, and OEMs all supporting their stack)
2. relies on the biggest players to come together and leaves the community and home/business owners to simply be better informed of their purchase decisions and better manage their devices). 
3. leaves the thriving incentivized DIY community's resourcefulness and expertise out of the picture
